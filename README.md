# Notes on the application

IN THIS VERSION, REGISTER NEW USERS IS HIDDEN.

Personal blogging site for Marcus Jensen. The admin user can: login, edit posts, and delete posts. Any non-logged in user can see the posts, but don't have full CRUD functionality.

Eventually, I will hide the 'New User' tab on the Navbar, as I don't want random people creating accounts, loggin in, and writing entries to my blog. As of now, this blog contains no real posts, and is a test deployment used for learning services.
